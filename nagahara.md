## Abstract
In this presentation, we will introduce the maximum hands-off control, also known as L0-optimal control. Maximum hands-off control minimizes the length of the support (i.e. the L0 norm) of the control among all feasible controls. We will see that the L0-optimal control is equivalent to the classical L1-optimal control (also known as minimum-fuel control) under a mild assumption. We also show extension of maximum hands-off control to discrete-valued control and distributed control.
